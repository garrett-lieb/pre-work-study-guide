# Prework-Study-Guide

## Description

This webpage was created as a Prework Study Guide for the precourse work at the U of Oregon coding bootcamp in October of 2023. It was created with the intention of logging infomration from the course work and to independantly practice using the basicsc of the subjects covered. Namely: HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Git/Github. The webpage was built step by step as these concepts were introduced, and used by students to see how these components of a webpage work in concert as they are introduced. Through this exercise students began to gain an understanding of the buidling blocks of a web application: the HTML that gives it a framework, the CSS that informs the aesthetics of the webiste, and the interactivity from Javascript. Throughout the project students practiced creating branches from a Git repository and then remerging the branch with the main repo once a step or steps were compltered.

## Usage

This webpage is intended to be used as a study guide for the materials covered in the U of Oregon coding bootcamp course prework. Each section contains notes about HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript. When the Chrome DevTools are opened by pressing Command+Option+I (macOS) or Control+Shift+I (Windows), the user can see Javascript running. Reloading the page will suggest a different topic for the user to study from the list of topics the students had learned about to that point in their course work.
